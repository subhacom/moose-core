# MOOSE

MOOSE is the Multiscale Object-Oriented Simulation Environment. It is designed
to simulate neural systems ranging from subcellular components and biochemical
reactions to complex models of single neurons, circuits, and large networks.
MOOSE can operate at many levels of detail, from stochastic chemical
computations, to multicompartment single-neuron models, to spiking neuron
network models.

MOOSE is multiscale: It can do all these calculations together. For example
it handles interactions seamlessly between electrical and chemical signaling.
MOOSE is object-oriented. Biological concepts are mapped into classes, and
a model is built by creating instances of these classes and connecting them
by messages. MOOSE also has classes whose job is to take over difficult
computations in a certain domain, and do them fast. There are such solver
classes for stochastic and deterministic chemistry, for diffusion, and for
multicompartment neuronal models.

MOOSE is a simulation environment, not just a numerical engine: It provides
data representations and solvers (of course!), but also a scripting interface
with Python, graphical displays with Matplotlib, PyQt, and VPython, and
support for many model formats. These include SBML, NeuroML, GENESIS kkit
and cell.p formats, HDF5 and NSDF for data writing.

This is the core computational engine of [MOOSE
simulator](https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose). This repository
contains C++ codebase and python interface called `pymoose`. For more

# v4.3.1 – Incremental Release over v4.3.0 "Lavang Latika"

[`Lavang Latika`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laung_lata) (also known as 
Lobongo Lotika or Laung Lata) is a traditional Indian sweet from Bengal, 
Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, and Bihar. It is made of flour pastry filled 
with khoya (mawa) and nuts, folded and sealed with a clove (lavang), then 
deep-fried and soaked in sugar syrup. The clove gives it a distinctive aroma.

## Quick Install

Installing released version from PyPI using `pip`

This version is available for installation via `pip`. To install the
latest release, we recommend creating a separate environment using
conda, mamba, micromamba, or miniforge to manage dependencies cleanly
and avoid conflicts with other Python packages. The `conda-forge`
channel has all the required libraries available for Linux, macOS,
and Windows.

```
conda create -n moose python=3.13 gsl hdf5 numpy vpython matplotlib -c conda-forge
```
```
conda activate moose
```

```
pip install pymoose
```

## Post installation

You can check that moose is installed and initializes correctly by running:

```
$ python -c "import moose; ch = moose.HHChannel('ch'); moose.le()"
```

This should show

```
Elements under /
    /Msgs
    /clock
    /classes
    /postmaster
    /ch
```

Now you can import moose in a Python script or interpreter with the statement:

```
>>> import moose
```
## Updates in 4.3.1

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed `moose.element()` to return the correct MOOSE object type
  instead of a generic object
- Fixed boolean field assignment to accept Python integers 0 and 1
  in addition to True/False
- Fixed an issue where valid very small time constant (tau) values
  were incorrectly treated as singular in HH gate expressions
- Fixed ICG channel prototypes producing NaN values during simulation
  when copied from a prototype in the library

### Improvements
- Reinstated `setField` function for backward compatibility with
  existing scripts
- Added `plotMorphology` and `plotMorphologyGraph` utilities for
  quick visual inspection of loaded neuron morphologies

## What's New in 4.3.0
 
### Ion Channel Library
 
Access over 3,517 ion channel models from the
[ICGenealogy database](https://icg.neurotheory.ox.ac.uk/) through the new
`moose.channels` module. Supported ion classes include Na, K, Ca, KCa,
and IH. Insert channels into compartments using wildcards, lists, or
dictionaries, with support for distance-dependent conductance.
 
Channel metadata includes both `modeldb_id` (ModelDB reference) and
`icg_id` (unique ICGenealogy identifier) for precise channel identification.
 
**Features:**
- Search, info, and make_prototype accept `icg_id` as an alternative to `modeldb_id`
- Simplified prototype naming format: `{suffix}_{modeldb_id}`
- New `get_icg_id` function to retrieve ICG identifier for a channel
### Morphology Library
 
The new `moose.morphologies` module simplifies loading and working with
neuron morphologies. Load SWC files and access compartments via `.root`,
`.soma`, `.compartments`, and `.select(pattern)`. Includes automatic
re-rooting of SWC files not rooted at soma.
 
**Bundled morphologies from:**
- [Allen Cell Types Database](https://celltypes.brain-map.org/)
- Traub et al. 2005 thalamocortical network model
- Classic published literature

**Utilities:**
- Convert GENESIS `.p` files to SWC format (`moose.swc_utils.p_to_swc`)

### Bug Fixes
 
- Python's `**` operator now works in MOOSE expressions
  (e.g., `func.expr = 'x0**2'`), in addition to the existing `^` operator
- Fixed `ReadSwc` to detect and handle 3-point soma and linear soma chains
- Fixed `HHGateF2D::lookupB` not setting voltage and concentration
  values from input vector
  
### Documentation
 
- Updated Ubuntu build instructions with clearer steps
- Fixed MOOSE website address in README

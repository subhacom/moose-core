"""Normalize an SBML document to a canonical shape before mapping.

We lean on libsbml's own converters instead of hand-rolling these transforms
(as the legacy reader did). After normalization the mapper only ever sees:
  * function definitions inlined into the expressions that use them,
  * initial assignments folded into initial values where possible,
  * local (per-kinetic-law) parameters promoted to global parameters,
  * assignment rules topologically sorted into evaluation order.

We deliberately do NOT convert SBML level/version: libsbml's read API is
largely level-agnostic, and level conversion can *fail* and reject an otherwise
loadable model. Units are handled explicitly at map time rather than via the
units converter, whose behaviour on under-specified models is unreliable.

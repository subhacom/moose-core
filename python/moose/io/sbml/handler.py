# handler.py --- moose.io.FormatHandler implementation for SBML
#
# A wrapper over all the read logic in reader.py and all the write
# logic in writer.py, each exposing one module-level function
# (`reader.read`, `writer.write`) that does the real work and needs no
# knowledge of the other direction; this class just adapts them to the
# moose.io.base.FormatHandler protocol (paired read/write methods on
# one object, with the coverage report kept on self so callers can
# inspect what did not come through faithfully).

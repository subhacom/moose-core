  instead of a generic object
- Fixed boolean field assignment to accept Python integers 0 and 1
  in addition to True/False

  when copied from a prototype in the library
- Fixed NeuroML2 reader failing to load Ca-dependent ion channels
  correctly
- Fixed a NameError that could occur when loading NeuroML2 channels
  with custom dynamics

### Improvements
- Reinstated `setField` function for backward compatibility with
  existing scripts

### Ion Channel Library

Access over 3,517 ion channel models from the
[ICGenealogy database](https://icg.neurotheory.ox.ac.uk/) through the new
`moose.channels` module. Supported ion classes include Na, K, Ca, KCa,
and IH. Insert channels into compartments using wildcards, lists, or
dictionaries, with support for distance-dependent conductance.

Channel metadata includes both `modeldb_id` (ModelDB reference) and
`icg_id` (unique ICGenealogy identifier) for precise channel identification.

**Features:**
- Search, info, and make_prototype accept `icg_id` as an alternative to `modeldb_id`
- Simplified prototype naming format: `{suffix}_{modeldb_id}`
- New `get_icg_id` function to retrieve ICG identifier for a channel

### Morphology Library

The new `moose.morphologies` module simplifies loading and working with
neuron morphologies. Load SWC files and access compartments via `.root`,
`.soma`, `.compartments`, and `.select(pattern)`. Includes automatic
re-rooting of SWC files not rooted at soma.

**Bundled morphologies from:**
- [Allen Cell Types Database](https://celltypes.brain-map.org/)
- Traub et al. 2005 thalamocortical network model
- Classic published literature

**Utilities:**
- Convert GENESIS `.p` files to SWC format (`moose.swc_utils.p_to_swc`)

### Bug Fixes

- Python's `**` operator now works in MOOSE expressions
  (e.g., `func.expr = 'x0**2'`), in addition to the existing `^` operator
- Fixed `ReadSwc` to detect and handle 3-point soma and linear soma chains
- Fixed `HHGateF2D::lookupB` not setting voltage and concentration
  values from input vector

### Documentation

- Updated Ubuntu build instructions with clearer steps
- Fixed MOOSE website address in README

**ICGenealogy project** and the **Vogels group** at IST Austria.

### Morphology Utilities (ShapeShifter)

The SWC conversion utilities (`moose.swc_utils.p_to_swc`) and morphology
processing features are based on **ShapeShifter**, developed by
**Prof. Avrama Blackwell and her team** at George Mason University.

ShapeShifter is a morphology processing utility that converts 3D neuronal
morphology files (`.swc` or GENESIS `.p`) into electrical compartmental
structures suitable for simulations. It can combine compartments with the
same (or similar) radius and reduce file size by up to 90% while preserving
electrotonic response.

- **Repository:** https://github.com/neurord/ShapeShifter
- **Used in:** `moose.swc_utils`, `moose.morphologies` (GENESIS `.p` file support),
  `python/moose/ShapeShifter/`

If you use morphology conversion or reduction features in your research,
please acknowledge Prof. Blackwell's group and the ShapeShifter project.


## [4.2.0] - 2026-03-31

Kalakand

## Breaking Changes
- Some legacy and unused Python utility modules have been removed.
If your scripts import from `moose.recording`, `moose.constants`, or
`moose.method_utils`, you will need to update them.
- `getFieldDict` has been renamed to `getFieldTypeDict`. If your
scripts use this function, update the name accordingly.

## Neuron Morphology (SWC) Improvements

- Improved support for loading neuron morphologies: SWC files with
2-point soma (as used by Arbor) and 3-point soma formats are now
handled correctly
- Automated SWC compartmentalization using uniform RA and RM based on [ShapeShifter](https://github.com/neurord/ShapeShifter)
- Added a dedicated `moose.loadSwc()` function for loading SWC files
with optional electrical parameters (RM, RA, CM)

## Model Loading Improvements
- Added explicit `moose.loadKkit()` function for loading GENESIS Kkit models
- NeuroML2 model path is now configurable instead of being hardcoded

## Python Interface Improvements

- Consistent and informative string representation for all MOOSE Python
objects, making debugging and interactive use easier
- `getFieldNames()` is now available as a method in MOOSE objects

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed incorrect behaviour when setting attributes on element fields
via Python
- Fixed an intermittent issue where expression evaluation could fail
unpredictably under certain conditions
- Fixed missing runtime dependencies for NeuroML2 module (pint, scipy)

## Build and Packaging

- Python bindings rebuilt on nanobind, replacing pybind11, resulting
in faster and smaller code
- Building MOOSE from source is now simpler, with fewer manual setup
steps required
- Updated CI workflows for the new build system

## [4.1.4] - 2026-01-12
Jhangri

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a crash (segmentation fault) that could occur when deleting Function objects
- Fixed incorrect evaluation order in Function objects that could lead to wrong results in some models
- Improved stability of expression parsing when working with dynamically changing expressions

### Model Import Improvements
- Improved SWC morphology reader with clearer hierarchical naming scheme for dendritic compartments, making imported neuron structures easier to interpret and debug

### Documentation
- Updated build instructions for macOS

### Build and Packaging
- Improved GitHub Actions workflows for release packages
- Enabled manual triggering of release workflows
- Fixed permission issues during GitHub release creation



## [4.1.1] - 2025-06-23
Jhangri

### Added 
- Added `HHChannelF` and `HHGateF` for formula-based evaluation of Hodgkin-Huxley type gating parameters
- Added a formula interface for `HHGate`: Users can now assign string formula in `exprtk` syntax to `alphaExpr`, `betaExpr`, `tauExpr` and `infExpr` to fill up the               tables. These can take either `v` for voltage or `c` for concentration as independent variable names in the formula.
- Added `moose.sysfields` to display system fields like `fieldIndex`, `numData` etc.

### FIXED
1. `bool` attribute handling added to `moose.vec`
2. More informative error message for unhandled attributes in `moose.vec`
3. Fixed issue #505
4. `moose.setCwe()` now handles str, element (ObjId) and vec (Id) parameters correctly
5. fixed `moose.showmsg()` mixing up incoming and outgoing messages.

## [4.1.0] - 2024-11-28
Jhangri
### Added
- Support for 2D HHGate/HHChannel in NeuroML reader
- Native binaries for Windows

### Fixed
- Updated to conform to c/c++-17 standard

### Changed
- `HHGate2D`: separate `xminA`, `xminB`, etc. for `A` and `B` tables
   replaced by single `xmin`, `xmax`, `xdivs`, `ymin`, `ymax`, and
   `ydivs` fields for both tables.
- Build system switched from `cmake` to `meson`

### Removed
- Temporarily removed NSDF support due to issues with finding HDF5 in
  a platform independent manner.

## [4.0.0] - 2022-04-15
Jalebi
### Added 
-  Addition of a thread-safe and faster parser based on ExprTK

### Changed
- A major under-the-hood change to numerics for chemical calculations,
  eliminating the use of 'zombie' objects for the solvers. This
  simplifies and cleans up the code and object access, but doesn't
  alter runtimes.

- Another major under-the-hood change to use pybind11 as a much
  cleaner way to interface the parser with the C++ numerical code.

- Resurrected objects for handling simulation output saving using HDF5
  format. There is an HDFWriter class, an NSDFWriter, and a new
  NSDFWriter2. The latter two implement storage in NSDF, Neuronal
  Simulation Data Format, Ray et al Neuroinformatics 2016. NSDF is
  built on HDF5 and builds up a specification designed to ensure ready
  replicability as well as self- description of model output.

- Multiple enhancements to rdesigneur, including vastly improved 3-D
  graphics output using VPython.

### Fixed
- Various bugfixes
